# This workflow builds and publishes executables for Windows-x64 and Linux-arm64.
# It compiles two targets in a matrix and then creates a GitHub Release (only on push).
# NOTE: To create Releases reliably when GITHUB_TOKEN is restricted, create a
# Personal Access Token (PAT) with repo/public_repo scope and save it as
# repository secret RELEASE_TOKEN, then this workflow will use that token.
